# train-awsssm - Train Plugin for using AWS Systems Manager Agent

This plugin allows applications that rely on Train to communicate via AWS SSM with Linux/Windows instances.

## Requirements

The instance in question must run on AWS and you need to have all AWS credentials set up for the shell which executes the command. Please check the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) for appropriate configuration files and environment variables.

You need the [SSM agent to be installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent.html) on the machine (most current AMIs already have this integrated) and the machine needs to have the managed policy `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` or a least privilege equivalent attached as IAM profile.

Commands will be executed under the `root`/`Administrator` users.

To confirm or troubleshoot the aws-ssm connection, reference the troubleshooting steps in [this AWS article](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/troubleshooting-managed-instances.html#instances-missing-solution-1).

## Installation

If you use this Gem as a plain transport you can use `gem install train-awsssm` but if you need it for InSpec you will need to do it via `inspec plugin install train-awsssm`, as InSpec does not use the global/user Gem directory by default.

You can build and install this gem on your local system as well via a Rake task: `rake install:local`.

## Transport parameters

| Option               | Explanation                                       | Default          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `host`               | IP, DNS name or EC2 ID of instance                | (required)       |
| `mode`               | Mode for connection, only 'run-command' currently | run-command      |
| `execution_timeout`  | Maximum time until timeout                        | 60               |
| `recheck_invocation` | Interval of rechecking AWS command invocation     | 1.0              |
| `recheck_execution`  | Interval of rechecking completion of command      | 1.0              |
| `instance_pagesize`  | Paging size for EC2 instance retrieval            | 100              |

## Limitations

Currently, this transport is limited to executing commands via the `AWS-RunShellScript` command which means there is no file upload/download capability.

Support for proper use of the AWS Session Manager, which allows complete tunneling, is planned.

## Example use

### In Code

```ruby
require "train-awsssm"
train  = Train.create("awsssm", {
            host:     "172.16.3.12",
            logger:   Logger.new($stdout, level: :info)
         })
conn   = train.connection
result = conn.run_command("apt upgrade -y")
conn.close
```

### Using the InSpec CLI

#### Additional requirement: 
You need InSpec installed on the machine from which you wish to run the command. There are multiple ways to install InSpec including through Progress Chef or CINC. Reference the following links for some options.
- [Progress Chef Documentation](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/install/)
- [CINC Documentation](https://cinc.sh/download/)

_Remeber to apply AWS credentials to your environment that will have permission to access the target over aws-ssm. There are multiple ways to store credentials which you can read about in [AWS Credential Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html). Once your credentials are loaded, reference [this AWS article](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/troubleshooting-managed-instances.html#instances-missing-solution-1) to troubleshoot and issues with the connection and understand additional details about what is required._

#### Example Usage

```bash
# Using aws-instance-id
inspec exec <path-to-profile> --target awsssm://<aws-instance-id>
# Or use target IP
inspec exec <path-to-profile> --target awsssm://<aws-target-ip>

# Examples
inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/redhat-enterprise-linux-7-stig-baseline/archive/main.tar.gz --target awsssm://i-00f1868f8f3b4eb03
inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/redhat-enterprise-linux-7-stig-baseline/archive/main.tar.gz --target awsssm://10.20.30.40
```
